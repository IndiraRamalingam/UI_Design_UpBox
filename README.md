Types of Breakpoints in Bootstrap:-

There are four types of breakpoints in bootstrap. They are small (sm), medium (md), large (lg), and extra-large (xl). Also, there is a default size breakpoint for web pages. That is extra-small (xs).

      1. Small (sm)
            576px and greater screen sizes use small breakpoints. Ex- mobiles. 
            Syntax – @media only screen and (min-width: 576px) {...}

      2. Medium (md)
            768px and greater screen sizes use the medium breakpoints. Ex-tablets.  
            Syntax - @media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {...}

      3. Large (lg)
            992px and greater screen sizes use the large breakpoints. Ex- laptops. 
            Syntax – @media only screen and (min-width: 992px) {...}

      4. Extra-large (xl)
            1200px and greater screen sizes use the extra-large breakpoints. Ex: Desktops.
            Syntax – @media only screen and (min-width: 1200px) {...}
